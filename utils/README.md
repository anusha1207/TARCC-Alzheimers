## utils.py
The utils module currently contains only one function (log_features), that takes in a Pandas dataframe. The function prints all feature names, along
with their datatypes. If the log parameter is specified, it also creates a .log file with the specified name. This function is a good sanity check
to make sure that data cleaning and encoding is working.
