The scientific objectives of focus are:

  1) Determine biological and non-biological risk factors for
     Alzheimer’s and analyze the weight of influence of
     these factors in developing or resisting the progress of
     Alzheimer’s Disease.
     
  2) Develop an effective and economically viable analysis
     method to predict the risk of early-onset Alzheimer’s
     disease, with an intent to replace PET, MRI and CT scans
     in the future.
