# TARCC_F22
My development environment consists of the following documents and highlighted points:
  - Initial analysis of genetic dataset. Due to lack of information and coherant data, we will not pursue the genetic dataset         until further directions.
  - IPYNB containing the data science pipeline, including all the scripts for analysis on non-genetic dataset
  - Data Wrangling and Preprocessing
  - EDA, pandas profiling for visualization
  - Kmodes Analysis, clustering, elbow method with visualizations
  - Feature selection using P-values and Random Forest Classfier Feature Importances
  - Prepping Data for modeling (consists of various csv data sets as checkpoints and further analyses)
  - Interpret the data - selecting top features that are highly important and correlated to our target variable
  - Execute and evaluate the machine learning model
  - Modular codes ready for future integration/embedment
